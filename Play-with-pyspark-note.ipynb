    "* Spark uses the paradigm of lazy evalution, which means operations like `sc.textFile` will not load anything until an action like `count()` is invoked on RDD.\n",

    "    * Master URL: This URL can be local[n] for local mode, Spark://[sparkip] for the Spark server, or mesos://path for a Mesos cluster\n",

    "    * The `SparkContext` object was the connection to a Spark execution environment and created RDDs and others,\n",

    "    * `HiveContext` interacted with the Hive stores.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Spark 2.0 introduced Datasets/DataFrames as the main distributed data abstraction interface and the SparkSession object as the entry point to a Spark execution environment. \n",
    "    * you can get SparkContext object form SparkSession object\n",
    "    * you will need SparkCLuster for doing execution environment operations, such as accumulators, addFile, addJars, and so on.\n",
    "    * However, for operations such as reading and creating Datasets, use the SparkSession object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* SparkSession unifies more than the context, it also unifies the process of reading data in different formats\n",
    "    * Build a SparkSession object (or using the one created in the case of spark-shell/pyspark)\n",
    "    * Use the SparkSession object for reads, creating views for SQL statements, and creating Datasets and DataFrames\n",
